Appsdeck Buildpack for Node.js
==============================

This is the official buildpack for Node.js and Meteor apps. If you fork this repository, please **update this README** to explain what your fork does and why it's special.


How it Works
------------

Here's an overview of what this buildpack does:

- Uses the [semver.io](https://semver.io) webservice to find the latest version of node that satisfies the [engines.node semver range](https://npmjs.org/doc/json.html#engines) in your package.json.
- Allows any recent version of node to be used, including [pre-release versions](https://semver.io/node.json).
- Uses an [S3 caching proxy](https://github.com/heroku/s3pository#readme) of nodejs.org for faster downloads of the node binary.
- Discourages use of dangerous semver ranges like `*` and `>0.10`.
- Uses the version of `npm` that comes bundled with `node`.
- Puts `node` and `npm` on the `PATH` so they can be executed with [appsdeck run](http://doc.appsdeck.eu/app/jobs).
- Caches the `node_modules` directory across builds for fast deploys.
- Doesn't use the cache if `node_modules` is checked into version control.
- Runs `npm rebuild` if `node_modules` is checked into version control.
- Always runs `npm install` to ensure [npm script hooks](https://npmjs.org/doc/misc/npm-scripts.html) are executed.
- Always runs `npm prune` after restoring cached modules to ensure cleanup of unused dependencies.
